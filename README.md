🏥 Asthma Patient Monitoring & ER Visit Reduction Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on solving a key healthcare challenge: identifying asthma patients at high risk of frequent emergency room (ER) visits.
The dashboard provides a clear, data-driven view of patient risk factors to support early intervention and preventive care.
❗ Business Problem

Healthcare providers lack an easy way to:

Monitor asthma patient outcomes
Identify patients with poor asthma control
Understand how medication adherence and lifestyle factors impact ER visits
As a result, hospitals face:
Increased ER visits
Higher treatment costs
Reactive instead of preventive care

🎯 Objective

To build a  dashboard that helps:
Identify high-risk asthma patients
Analyze ER visit patterns
Highlight key contributing factors such as medication adherence, activity level, and environmental exposure

📊 Key KPIs

Total Patients
Total ER Visits
Average ER Visits per Patient
High-Risk Patients Count
% of Patients with Poor Asthma Control
ER Visits by Medication Adherence

🔍 Key Insights

Patients with low medication adherence show higher ER visit frequency
Poor asthma control is directly linked to increased ER usage
Sedentary lifestyle groups have more ER visits compared to active patients
Certain demographic and lifestyle segments require prioritized care
